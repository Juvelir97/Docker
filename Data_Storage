Storage options:
    1) Volumes
          Docker volumes store the data directly into the host's filesystem
          They are the best way to persist data
          Docker stores volumes in /var/lib/docker/volumes
          You can share a volume with multiple containers
    2) Bind mounts
          allow you to mount an existing host directory as a filesystem on the container
          That enables you to share important files with the Docker container
          Bind mounts also allow multiple processes to modify data along with Docker
          if you are sharing your container data with another application that is not running in Docker 
    3) tmpfs mounts
          mounts store data in memory.
          They do not store any data on disk
