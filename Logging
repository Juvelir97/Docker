Configuring logging steps:
    1) docker info | grep "Logging Driver"
    2) vim /etc/docker/daemon.json
    3) {
          "log-driver": "<driver>"
        }
    4) sudo systemctl restart docker
    
    
Following logging drivers are available:
• none: There are no logs available for the container, and therefore they are not stored
anywhere.
• local: Logs are stored locally in a custom format and therefore minimizes
overhead.
• json-file: The log files are stored in a JSON format, and this is the default
Docker logging driver.
• syslog: Uses syslog for storing the Docker logs as well. This option makes sense
when you use syslog as your default logging mechanism.
• journald: Uses journald to store Docker logs. You can use the journald
command line to browse the container logs and the Docker daemon logs.
• gelf: Sends logs to a Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) endpoint such as
Graylog or Logstash.
• fluentd: Sends logs to Fluentd.
• awslogs: Sends logs to AWS CloudWatch.
• splunk: Sends logs to Splunk using the HTTP Event Collector.
• etwlogs: Sends logs to Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events. You can use it
only on Windows platforms.
• gcplogs: Sends logs to Google Cloud Logging.
• logentries: Sends logs to Rapid7 Logentries.


Json file logging example
        docker run --name nginx-json-file --log-driver json-file -d nginx
        Log file location /var/lib/docker/containers/<container_id>/<container_id>-json.log.
